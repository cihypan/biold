/** README (yes, read this):

  Subtility is really more of an IRC framework than an IRC bot.
  The idea is to provide an easy, stable interface to IRC, just
  add callbacks. Callbacks are called on different IRC events,
  such as onOp, onJoin, onQuit, etc.
  
  This file gives examples of callbacks and the implementation of the
  callbacks to the ircBot class.

  Channel modes are now split up and working properly, currently only
  the channel events:
    onOp/onDeOp, onVoice/onDeVoice, onBan/onUnban
  are registered for channel modes, all other modes will be passed to onMode
  individually...
  
  There are still minor odds n ends that need tweaking, but the overall
  implementation is completely stable. The framework is used on a live IRC bot
  which saves channel/server information into a MySQL database, as well as reads
  the users database into the configuration. Already changes from the new bot
  have come into the current framework. Reconnections and failed connections
  should not be too much of a problem now, and it will rotate between the list
  of servers if it can't connect, if stayAlive is set the bot will keep trying.
  
  --------------------- GETTING STARTED ---------------------------
    The configuration values below will need to be edited, as well
    as #!/usr/local/bin/php to your PHP path or run it as
    ./bot.php &
    to put it in the background, then you can
    tail -f log/<botNickNameGoesHere>.log
    which will show you the log data as it recieves it. It has to
    be done this way because PHP treats the output wierdly.
    
    To view the raw IRC output subtility recieves, set ircDebug to
    true, this will also display any other debug data.
    
    See the callback functions and comments below for an idea of how
    the callbacks work. It's fairly simple...

// 
// well thanks for your work Don,
// 
// i decided to use this bot, and add on a bunch of stuff
// originally it was to be used as 'old' bot... meaning
// that if you add on the database to it, it will capture urls from
// the channel that it is in, and silently add them in
// and yell OLD OLD if url has been pasted before
// added on horoscope
// google
// lame eliza ai
// stock ticker
// weather
//   - forecast
// warez releases (along the same lines as urls)
// babelfish translation
//

// bioh

this is my first attempt at making this public again, 
there have been countless changes to this source since it's initial inception by mr Don

things that should be done here still
- cleanup :(  
- update to php5 (probably update the irc connect class, the current one sucks)


to start this up initially

1) mysqladmin -p create bot_db
2) mysql -p bot_db < bot.schema.sql
3) edit bot.php  (enter username / password you are using for this bot_db)
4) edit bot.php  - set up your admin and channel / server to connect to 
5) start up the bot in a screen session or ... something
