2003-07-21, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: SOAPAction header is quoted again, fixes problem w/ Weblogic Server
- applied Jason Levitt patch for proper array serialization, fixes problem w/ Amazon shopping cart services
- fixed null value serialization
- applied patch from "BZC ToOn'S" - fixes wsdl serialization when no parameters

2003-07-22, version 0.6.5
- soap_server: fixed bug causing charset encoding not to be passed to the parser
- soap_fault: added default encoding to the fault serialization
- soap_parser: changed the parser to pre-load the parent's result array when processing scalar values. This increases parsing speed.

2003-07-23, version 0.6.5
- soap_base: fix code that overwrites user-supplied attributes in serialize_val
- soap_base: use arrays-of-arrays rather than attempting multi-dimensional in serialize_val
- xmlschema: emit import statements and qualify all elements with prefix in serializeSchema (better interop with validation tools)
- soapclient: get xml character encoding from HTTP Content-Type header if provided, e.g. text/xml;charset="UTF-8"
- soapclient: use headers in call if provided (previously ignored this parameter)
- soap_server: in parse_request, if neither getallheaders nor $_SERVER are available, use $HTTP_SERVER_VARS to get SOAPAction and xml encoding

2003-07-24, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: apply patch from Steven Brown "if the server closes connection prematurely, nusoap would spin trying to read data that isn't there"

2003-07-25, version 0.6.5
- wsdl: apply patch from Sven to workaround single schema limitation
- wsdl: apply a variant of the patch from Holger to handle empty values for array by serializing an array with 0 elements
- xmlschema: remove the redundant default namespace attribute on the schema element; everything in xsd is explicitly specified as being from xsd
- soap_transport_http: fix setCredentials and add TODO comments in sendHTTPS about what to change if this setCredentials stays

2003-07-30, version 0.6.5
- nusoap_base: change documentation of soap_defencoding to specify it is the encoding for outgoing messages
- nusoap_base: only change &, <, > to entities, not all HTML entities
- soap_transport_http: update the Content-Type header in sendRequest, since soap_defencoding could be changed after ctor is called
- soap_server: use soap_defencoding instead of charset_encoding
- soap_server: read encoding from _SERVER if available
- nusoap_base: do entity translation for string parameters with an xsd type specified (thanks David Derr)

2003-07-31, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: add proxy authentication
- soap_transport_http: build payload the same way for http and https
- wsdl: add proxy authentication
- soapclient: add proxy authentication
- soapclient: allow proxy information in ctor, so that it can be used for wsdl

2003-08-01, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: close a persistent connection that's at EOF
- soap_transport_http: prevent conflicts between setEncoding and usePersistentConnection
- soap_transport_http: fix use of $headers instead of $this->incoming_headers in getResponse
- soapclient: improve handling of persistent connections
- soapclient: force xml_encoding to upper case
- soap_server: let the Web server decide whether to close the connection (no Connection: close header)
- soap_server: force xml_encoding to upper case

2003-08-04, version 0.6.5
- soap_parser: use XML type information to pick a PHP data type; also decode base64
- soap_server: read all HTTP headers when using _SERVER or HTTP_SERVER_VARS
- soap_server: add gzip encoding support for outgoing messages
- soap_transport_http: deflate is gzcompress/gzuncompress (cf. http://archive.develooper.com/libwww@perl.org/msg04650.html)
- soap_transport_http: clean use of persistentConnection so it's always a set boolean
- soapclient: add responseData member to access deflated/gunzipped payload

2003-08-05, version 0.6.5
- soap_server: look multiple places when setting debug_flag

2003-08-07, version 0.6.5
- nusoap_base: serialize specified type (e.g. ArrayOfString) even for simple array
- wsdl: only specify encodingStyle in the input/output soap bindings when it is not empty (thanks Guillaume)

2003-08-15, version 0.6.5
- soap_parser: fix parsing of elements with no XSD type specified
- soap_parser: use PHP string type for XSD long and unsignedLong types

- soap_parser: fix another line of code generating a warning (thanks Torsten)

2003-08-22, version 0.6.5
- soap_server: remove all '--' from debug_str; previous code changed '---' to '- --'
- wsdl, soapclient, soap_parser: patch submitted by Mark Spavin as described by
                                 the following...
> Changes for the multiple/nested imports from the wsdl file. This builds an
> array of files not just the last one and also checks for relative paths to
> the parent. This will then get the imported files from the remote site
> instead of your local disk. Local wsdl files should still work (untested).
>
> Changes for multiple encoding sytles as previously posted

2003-08-24, version 0.6.5
- wsdl, soapclient: fix some PHP notices from previous update

2003-08-26, version 0.6.5
- wsdl: support multiple SOAP ports
- soapclient, soap_server: when no charset is specified, use UTF-8, even though HTTP specifies US-ASCII.
- soap_transport_http: do not prepend $host with 'ssl://' for https (is this required for older cURL versions?)

2003-08-28, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: disable cURL verification of peer and server (formerly the cURL default)
- soap_transport_http: mingle cURL code with straight http, so sendHTTP is no longer needed
