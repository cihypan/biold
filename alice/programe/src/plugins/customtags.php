INSTRUCTIONS

If you want to put custom tags into your templates you need to define functions to handle those tags in this file.

Define the function with the name ct_customtagname. Setup the function to be passed the parameters $xmlnode, $inputstar, $thatstar, and $topicstar.

After the function has been defined it will automatically be called to handle XML that matches your custom tag name.

Please review the examples below.

/*
Example:
You want to build email capabilities into the bot and have invented an <email> tag.
Example of how your new email tag will be used:
	<category>
	  <pattern>EMAIL PAUL AND TELL HIM *</pattern>
	  <template>Okay. I emailed him. <email to="paul@rydell.com"><star/></email></template>
	</category>
*/

	$sendto=$mynode["TO"];

Example:
